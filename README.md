# PizzaClassifier

This is an sample implementation of pizza classification app with CreatML and SwiftUI.

Using CreateML gives you the opportunity to train your own ML model.
At this time, I collected 7 types pizza(Greek, Margherita, Meat, New Yourk-Style, Pepparoni, Sicilian, Veggie) images and then train and test it.
Accuracy is not enough to use this app on a daily basis though, I'm satisfied with what I've learned about the way to create an ML model.
